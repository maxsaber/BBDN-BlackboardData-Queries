## Blackboard Learn - File breakdown by course item type at course level

This query allows you to see a breakdown of the number of files and total file size for each of the File Types in a Blackboard Learn Course.

The default filter is Course Name, but you can choose other possible filters in the `WHERE` clause, such as:
- Blackboard Data Course ID (`id`)
- Blackboard Learn Course ID (`source_id`) 
- Course Item Type (`item_type`)
